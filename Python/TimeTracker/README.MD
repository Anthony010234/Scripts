This script is an upgraded version of KeepAwake. KeepAwake only has a command line interface

Built using this command:
pyinstaller --noconsole --icon "stopwatch_icon-icons.com_64805.ico" TimeTracker.py --clean

After building, need to copy the icon to the dist root directory as well to make sure the application can load
